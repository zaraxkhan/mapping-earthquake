# mapping-earthquakes
With the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS styling, I created a map in VSCode that share the location of tectonic plates on Earth as well as earthwuakes that have occured in the past week.

## Overview
First I creates an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, for the challenge, I created a map with the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, shared all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and a third map type.
